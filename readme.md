# Welcome to ReeTUI!

Ever wanted a chat app that lives right in your terminal? Look no further! ReeTUI is here to save your day (and your RAM). Whether you're a CLI wizard, stuck on a server without a fancy desktop, or just someone who *loves* a good TUI, this is for you.

## Why ReeTUI is awesome (and a little bit crazy)

### Blazingly fast & super efficient
Seriously, this thing is *fast*. We're talking Rust! Both the backend and frontend are powered by Rust, so it's not gonna hog your precious RAM for no good reason. It's like a ninja, quick and light on its feet.

### Secure (but don't trust me, lol)
You can create as many accounts as your heart desires â€“ infinite, even! (Though maybe don't tell the FBI about this feature). This app is built for people to chat freely and have a good time. And yeah, there will be admins (that's me, :orpheus-smirk:) to keep things chill.

### Noice TUI (purrfect, even!)
Our TUI is, dare I say, *purrfect*. We've got theme switching, because who doesn't love a fresh look? And get this: there's even a random little surprise waiting for you if you pick a *very specific* username. Try your luck! *Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯* 

### Image preview (with animated GIFs!)
Yep, we support images! PNGs, JPEGs, JPGs, and even animated GIFs. Watch those memes come to life right in your terminal. It's magic!

### Cross-platform (Rust made us do it)
Because it's written in Rust, ReeTUI just *happens* to be cross-platform. We didn't even try, it just worked out that way. ðŸ˜‰

## How to get this bad boy running â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“

1.  **Get Chafa:**
    This is how we make those cool images appear. Grab it here: [https://hpjansson.org/chafa/download/](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/download/)

2.  **Grab a Nerd Font:**
    For the ultimate visual experience, you'll want one of these: [https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

3.  **Clone the repo (the usual drill):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YoussefDevPro/ReeTUI
    ```

4.  **Install Rust & Cargo (if you're not already a rustacean):**
    If you're new to the Rust fam, get Cargo here: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

5.  **Build & run (almost there!):**
    `cd` into the `ReeTUI/` directory, then hit it with:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    Once that's done, you're ready to rock and chat!
