# Welcome to ReeTUI

ReeTUI is a lightweight, terminal-based chat application designed for efficiency and speed. It's ideal for command-line interface (CLI) users, server environments without a desktop environment, or anyone who appreciates the power and simplicity of Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs).

## Features

### Fast and Efficient
Built entirely with Rust for both frontend and backend, ReeTUI offers blazing-fast performance and minimal RAM consumption.

### Secure
ReeTUI prioritizes free and open communication. While it allows for unlimited account creation, it's designed for casual chat and not for highly confidential discussions. Admins ensure a positive and respectful environment.

### Polished TUI
Experience a visually appealing TUI with theme switching capabilities. Discover hidden features, including a unique interaction tied to a specific username!

### Image Preview
ReeTUI supports a wide range of image formats, including animated GIFs, PNGs, JPEGs, and JPGs, directly within the terminal.

### Cross-Platform
Leveraging Rust's cross-platform capabilities, ReeTUI runs seamlessly across various operating systems.
